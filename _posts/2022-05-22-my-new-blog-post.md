## This is my first blog post
Being a data scientist is a combination of statistician and software engineer, as stated in the article "A data scientist is someone who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician." 
The major knowledge areas of data scientiest are 1. Strong knowledge of some coding softwars like Python, SAS, R, Scala.
                                                 2. Hands-on experience in SQL database coding. 
                                                 3. Ability to work with unstructured data from various sources like video and social media.
                                                 4. Understand multiple analytical functions.
                                                 5. Knowledge of machine learning, etc. 
As the saying goes, I think the similarity between a statistician and a data scientist is that they both have the same knowledge of statistics. 
The difference is that a data scientist will use more coding software to get the analysis results and then interpret them. 
I think I really like the combination of these two fields because I enjoy using the software to get the results and then using the statistical knowledge to analyze them to get useful information.
  ```tsql
 SELECT *
 FROM sys.tables
  WHERE [name] = 'SomeTable'
 ```
