# Feeling about R so far

Iâ€™m really impressed by how flexible the packages are, for example, the
ciTools that can add predict interval in plot.

Here is an example using ciTools package

``` r
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
fit <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
cars <- cars %>% ciTools::add_pi(fit, names = c("lower", "upper"))
```

    ## Warning in add_pi.lm(., fit, names = c("lower", "upper")): These PIs
    ## may have already been appended to your dataframe. Overwriting.

``` r
ggplot(cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist)) +
geom_point() +
geom_smooth(method = "lm", fill = "Blue") +
geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper), alpha = 0.3, fill = "Red") +
ggtitle("Scatter Plot with 95% PI & 95% CI")
```
