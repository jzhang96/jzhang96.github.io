# About project2

This project is primary use the variables in Online News Popularity Data
Set to predict the number of shares. This dataset summarizes a
heterogeneous set of features about articles published by Mashable in a
period of two years. The goal is to predict the number of shares in
social networks (popularity). Therefore, the `share` variable will be
the response variable in our model. In this project, we will use linear
regression, random forest and boosted tree model to predict the number
of shares.
