# Thoughts about R for data science

I think Iâ€™ll continue to use R going forward. This course let me realize
how versatile R is. Despite you can build your own function, there are
also lots of useful function that created by others shared for free.  
As long as you practice enough, it can meet many requirements when we
use it for data science purpose.

# Differently in practice

We will not only need to get the output from R but also have the ability
to interpret the output. The key in real life practice maybe how to
interpret the output.

# Interesting of exploring area

I found out I am really interesting about modeling part. I may going to
explore more about modeling part in data science. Despite knowing more
about which model suit for what kind of dataset. Evaluate the data is
also really important. You can start modeling until you did numeric
statistic about your dataset.
